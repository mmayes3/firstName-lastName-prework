// My word game project is a guessing game with an NFL theme. 
All of the words are NFL teams. It keeps track of the amount of wins the user has, 
their number of guesses remaining, and the letters the user has already guessed. 
This is a great way to build upon loops and expand more on tracking.
A surface level game like this is like a skeleton for word search applications that exist,
and any other types of word games. A user can get started with this project by first coming 
up with a general theme. Then the most important thing to do initially is to create a 
flow diagram to better understand how to go about each step. The loops will center on 
checking the letters, displaying the words, and displaying the letters guessed since these 
entire tasks center on keeping track of something and iterating the stings. A great way to get 
help with something like this is Google. Searching up functions and distinct methods 
should help clear any questions.
